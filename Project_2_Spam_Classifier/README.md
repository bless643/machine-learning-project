# Project 2 - Spam Classifier

## Project Goal
Build and evaluate a text classification model that detects spam messages (SMS or email). We will:
-Preprocess text data 
- Convert text into numeric features 
-Train two models 
- Evaluate with accuracy score, confusion matrux and classification report 
- Save best model for future use 

## learning Outcomes
- Text preprocessing
- Tranining and comparing Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier Algorithms
